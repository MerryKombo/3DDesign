# 3DDesign
Everything we'll design and print for this Merry Kombo project of ours.

For the time being, we have only designed :
 - the beginning of a box for the [OrangePi](https://www.sbc-community.org/) [RK3399](https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-rk3399/)
 - a [heatsink](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a2b712554439d54a4325f9c4/w/f2046d91200af6da026d18a3/e/130034f35837351a3c6391f2) for an [OrangePi](https://www.sbc-community.org/OrangePi%20Zero/) [Zero](https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-zero/)
 - a few bits and [bobs](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/670c0dcb20e9d88e955e134f/w/1035a103bbd1c8f163666206/e/51936ffd82cb6a0b55d4049d) for an [Odroid](https://www.armbian.com/odroid-hc1/) [MC1](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-mc1-solo/).
