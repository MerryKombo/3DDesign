Everything we'll design and print for this Merry Kombo project of ours.

For the time being, we have only designed :
 - the beginning of a [box](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/bd0aa71fccc858971abeeafb/w/0a8e2670ea3c8d1f67388ade/e/98ffc44ceced2584fd0335c2) for the [OrangePi](https://www.sbc-community.org/) [RK3399](https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-rk3399/)
