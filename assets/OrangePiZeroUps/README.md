This directory will host all the files linked to this subproject of [MerryKombo](https://github.com/MerryKombo).
The goal is to have the [OrangePi Zero](https://www.sbc-community.org/OrangePi%20Zero/#orangepi-zero) check the temperature of a module, control the fan accordingly, and give some information thanks to an I2C screen.
We want to be able to unplug the whole module and let the OrangePi Zero shutdown beautifully, hence the UPS.
