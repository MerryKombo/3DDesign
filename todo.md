# ToDo List for this project

## To Do

### Server

#### 1U

##### Rear Modules

- Make a specific module for the switch
- Make a specific module for the power supply

##### Module

- Use [thin-wall](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2/wiki/walls.scad#module-thinning_wall) to render the walls
- Use [cuboid](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL2/wiki/shapes3d.scad) to render the walls

##### Fan Module

- Add a nut to the reinforcement

##### Ears

- Make elongated holes
=======
##### Module

- Add the pin track on the right side
- Extract small parts as STL so that we can print and test them (sizes of the holes for the threaded rod, ear, the pin path and so on)
- Add a recess in the module to host a M5 nut, and a hole so that we can add a threaded rod to the front modules row on each wall, on top&bottom if possible
- Add a dovetail at the rear so that we can slide in back modules (with power, network, whatever)

## Done

### Server

##### Module

- Add a dovetail at the rear so that we can slide in back modules (with power, network, whatever)
- Add the pin track on the right side
- Extract small parts as STL so that we can print and test them (sizes of the holes for the threaded rod, ear, the pin path and so on)
- Add a recess in the module to host a M5 nut, and a hole so that we can add a threaded rod to the front modules row on each wall, on top&bottom if possible
- Add a fan module at the rear

#### Fan Module

- Shift the holes so that the dovetails don't get drilled
- Extend the male dovetails so that we have a complete width module
- Design a rear for the fan module so that we get a complete module
